                <h2>Starting Out</h2>
                <p>Starting out with baking can seem daunting, with all the videos of professionals with fancy tools and hard to find ingredients. However there are tons of easy recipes you can make with the ingredients and tools you probably already have at home. The internet is also a tremendous resource - you can look up ways to accomplish things without a stand mixer / hand mixer, ingredient substitutions, etc. Give it a shot and who knows, maybe you will get hooked too.</p>

                <h2>Art vs Science</h2>
                <p>I had a friend who once told me "Cooking is like art for hungry people, and baking is like science for hungry people" and I couldn't agree more. Baking is very much like chemistry, a change in measurement, order, or temperature can make a big difference. One key element is learning how to measure flour property. If you scoop flour up with your measuring cup it compacts and you wind up with more than you intended. Instead, use a spoon to scoop flour into the measuring cup and overfill it slightly, then use the back of a butter knife to level off the cup.</p>
                <p>My main exception to this is the secret to baking I learned from my mom. The recipe never calls for enough vanilla! I generally use 1.5 - 2 times the amount the recipe calls for. In most recipes this will not be enough of a change to cause any issues, though if you are making something very sensitive to liquid, such as scones, you may need to lower the amount of other liquids to account for the excess vanilla.</p>

                <h2>Decorating</h2>
                <p>Decorating is my favorite part of baking. I love making things look as good as they taste, or suprising friends with a beautiful creation for their birthday or celebration. For example, the image to the right shows some animal themed cupcase I made for a friend's baby shower.</p>
